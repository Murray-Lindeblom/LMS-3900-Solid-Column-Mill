# LMS-3900-Solid-Column-Mill

This is a freeCAD generated model for assisting in the CNC conversion 
of a LMS 3960 solid column mini-mill.

Another model of the typical SIEG X2 mini-mill is available at
https://grabcad.com/library/mini-mill-cx605-1

This is a Work-In-Progress.

Very few of the CNC components have been built and tested.

The X-axis components have been adjusted to as-built.

Use the design at your own risk.
